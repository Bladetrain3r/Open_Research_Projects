# Methodology

## Research Methodology

This document outlines the methodology and approach used in this research project.

### Research Design

The research follows a collaborative, open-source model where:
- Each hypothesis or experiment is tracked in a separate branch
- Code and data are version controlled
- Peer review is conducted through pull requests
- All changes are documented with detailed commit messages

### Data Collection

Data collection procedures should be:
- Documented in the SCRIPTS/ directory
- Reproducible by other researchers
- Version controlled alongside the analysis code

### Analysis Process

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess raw data
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Initial investigation of patterns
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Apply appropriate statistical methods
4. **Validation**: Verify results through testing and peer review

### Quality Assurance

- All scripts should include automated tests
- Code should be reviewed before merging
- Results should be reproducible
- Documentation should be kept up-to-date
